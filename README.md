# ClickMe - Solo Mini-Project

## Description

Click Me is my first mini-project that I've finished independently since completeing the Adelaide Coding Boot Camp.  Whilst not a complicated and technically impressive application it has been a very important milestone for me since the end of the course. The Adelaide Coding Boot Camp introduced me to many concepts of JavaScript, however, at times the pace of the course prevented me from solidfying these fundementals. (Nearly at this stage) Completeting this application helped me to re-learn and/ or confirm some of JavaScripts concepts in an independant fashion, allowing myself to feel confident in my ability to code and problem-solve.

Initally this application started with a very limited idea, click a button and have it randomly appear somewhere else on the screen. This quickly became a simple timer clicker game with score and and a scoreboard. When talking to family and friends about this mini-project their suggestions were slowly added my to-do list, "can the button change colour?", "can you reset the game?" and "can the button get smaller?". More and more ideas were added which has lead me to this application. This project was completed in my own free time in approximatly over one week.

My application heavily uses the programing interface for web documents (DOM) to access my content and style so that I was able to hide or show HTM elements, change colours, start a countdown and use a button to keep player score. Furthermore, this application uses local storage to set and recieve previous player score objects so they can be displayed on a scoreboard. My familarity with JavaScript in-built functions such as```Math.floor```, ```Math.random```, ```.push```, ```.appendChild```, ```setInterval``` and ```clearInterval``` has been greatly enhanced, allowing me to feel more confident implementing them in future coding projects.
